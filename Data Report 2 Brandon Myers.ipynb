    "Because I'm handpicking the albums for this, I have to make sure they are fit to be added to the data pool. For the albums I've selected, I've chosen a variety of music genres, and I don't use an artist more than once. Chosen albums must have at least two tracks of each type, solos and features. This ensures I can always get an average of each type of popularity score. Also, it seems that when getting tracks from an album, the api can only handle up to 20, so that should be taken note of. I tried to include albums with less than 20 tracks, but that's easier said than done. Also, popularity is VERY different from artist to artist, I've included bigger and smaller ones for the sake of variety. When I compare popularity, I do it relatively to other tracks in the same album, rather than the rest of the dataset."
